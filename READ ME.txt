My name is Scott Millar. I am a computer science student studying at Lincoln University and I am in my first year.

I am currently working through the problems on ProjectEuler.net to improve my programming skills, I originally started with 
Java however I have been taught C# at my university so have opted to carry on with that as I better with it. Project Euler
is a website which has many problems to be solved via programming. What I have done so far is in my Project
Euler Folder.
